Lane-keeping (LK) in self driving cars or autonomous driving requires to make decisions and consider multi-objective function like maximizing driving distance, minimizing lane deviations and collisions in real-time. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approach balance multi-objectives with hand-tuning reward functions, which requires scenario-specific tuning for the suitable weight coefficients. To address this challenge, we formulate LK as a constrained RL problem, where we use driving distance as the reward and other objectives, such as lane deviations and collisions, as cost constraints. Under this framework, the weight coefficients are also automatically learned along with the policy, eliminating the need for scenario-specific tuning. We evaluate our approach on a popular autonomous driving platform called Duckietown in both simulation and real-world settings. Empirically, our constrained approach outperforms various baselines on the Duckietown platform in terms of lane deviation safety and lane maintain reliability. Ablation studies demonstrate the insights into how constraint parameters affect trade-offs between safety and efficiency. Additionally, we have successfully transferred and validated our approach in real-world lane-keeping scenarios, which is crucial for demonstrating its practical value.
