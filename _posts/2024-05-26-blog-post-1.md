## Key Contributions
1. **AGGREVATE Algorithm**:
   - **Purpose**: Extends DAGGER by minimizing long-term cost-to-go instead of just immediate classification loss.
   - **Method**:
     1. Collect data by observing the expert and performing random explorations.
     2. Observe the resulting cost-to-go $$Q$$.
     3. Train policies $$\hat{\pi}_n$$ to minimize these costs.
   - **Algorithm Steps**:
     ```
     Initialize $$D \leftarrow \emptyset$$, $$\hat{\pi}_1 \leftarrow any policy in \Pi$$
     for $$i = 1$$ to $$N$$ do
         Collect $$m$$ data points as follows:
             for $$j = 1$$ to $$m$$ do
                 Sample uniformly $$t \in \{1, 2, \ldots, T\}$$
                 Start new trajectory in initial state $$s_1$$
                 Execute current policy $$\hat{\pi}_i$$ up to time $$t-1$$
                 Explore action $$a_t$$ in state $$s_t$$
                 Execute expert from time $$t+1$$ to $$T$$, observe cost-to-go $$Q$$
                 Add $$(s, t, a, Q)$$ to dataset $$D$$
         Train cost-sensitive classifier $$\hat{\pi}_{i+1}$$ on $$D$$
     Return best $$\hat{\pi}_i$$ on validation
     ```

2. **No-Regret Policy Iteration (NRPI)**:
   - **Purpose**: Adapts AGGREVATE for reinforcement learning using cost-to-go estimates.
   - **Method**:
     1. Collect cost-to-go examples by sampling from state distributions $$u_t$$.
     2. Explore actions and apply the current policy to estimate future costs.
     3. Train policies using a no-regret online learning algorithm.
   - **Algorithm Steps**:
     ```
     Initialize $$D \leftarrow \emptyset$$, $$\hat{\pi}_1 \leftarrow any policy in \Pi$$
     for $$i = 1$$ to $$N$$ do
         Collect $$m$$ data points as follows:
             for $$j = 1$$ to $$m$$ do
                 Sample uniformly $$t \in \{1, 2, \ldots, T\}$$
                 Sample state $$s_t$$ from exploration distribution $$
u_t$$
                 Execute exploration action $$a_t$$ in state $$s_t$$
                 Execute current policy $$\hat{\pi}_i$$ from time $$t+1$$ to $$T$$, observe cost-to-go $$Q$$
                 Add $$(s, a, t, Q)$$ to dataset $$D$$
         Train cost-sensitive classifier $$\hat{\pi}_{i+1}$$ on $$D$$
     Return best $$\hat{\pi}_i$$ on validation
     ```

## Key Equations and Theoretical Guarantees

1. **Performance Metric**:
   - Total cost of executing policy $$\pi$$ over $$T$$ steps:
     $$
     J(\pi) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \mathbb{E}_{s \sim d_t^\pi} [C(s, \pi(s))]
     $$

2. **Cost-to-Go Function**:
   - Expected future cost-to-go of executing action $$a$$ in state $$s$$ followed by policy $$\pi$$ for $$t-1$$ steps:
     $$
     Q^\pi_t(s, a)
     $$

3. **AGGREVATE Theoretical Guarantee**:
   - If a no-regret algorithm is used, as $$N \to \infty$$:
     $$
     \lim_{N 	o \infty} J(\pi) \leq J(\pi^*) + T \epsilon_{	ext{class}}
     $$

4. **NRPI Theoretical Guarantee**:
   - For any policy $$\pi'$$:
     $$
     J(\hat{\pi}) \leq J(\pi) \leq J(\pi') + T \epsilon_{	ext{regret}} + T Q_{\max} D(
u, \pi')
     $$
   - If a no-regret algorithm is used, as $$N \to \infty$$:
     $$
     \lim_{N 	o \infty} J(\pi) \leq J(\pi') + T Q_{\max} D(
u, \pi')
     $$

## Conclusion
By integrating cost-to-go information into no-regret learning frameworks, the paper presents significant advancements in both imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithms, AGGREVATE and NRPI, offer a unified approach with strong theoretical guarantees, enhancing the stability and effectiveness of learned policies in practical applications.
