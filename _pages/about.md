## üî¨ Research Experience

- **CRADLE: Constrained Reinforcement for Autonomous Driving Learning in Simulation-to-Real Environment**  
  *Status: Under Review, Oct 2022 - Present*  
  Introduce a constrained-RL based formulation for the AD problem. Develop a constrained-RL based algorithm that enables the vehicle to cover as much distance as possible along the correct lane while adhering to the constraints.

- **Mechanical Engineering Project: Individual Voting for RL and Search-based Algorithm Combination in Multi-agent Pathfinding**
  *Aug 2021~Oct 2022*  
  Proposed an Individual Voting mechanism to optimize the pathfinding algorithm's performance in dead/livelock situations. A decentralized RL algorithm and a centralized search-based algorithm are learned to combine.  

- **Final Year Project: Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control Problem**  
  *Sept 2020 - May 2021*  
  Implemented a RL-based algorithm for robust manipulator operation using RGB image inputs and Cartesian coordinate outputs. Achieved autonomous grasping for diverse workpiece structures.
