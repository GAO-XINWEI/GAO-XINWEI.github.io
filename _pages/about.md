I am currently a **Research Associate** under the **AI Singapore Programme** at the **CPS Research Group**, Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I possess in-depth expertise in machine learning research and algorithm development. My research interest includes:
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Learning to Optimization
  - Safety mechanisms of Machine Learning
  - Robotics System

In addition to these core areas, I am eager to expand my research into emerging fields that align with my current expertise, such as generative AI, recommender system, data mining, federated learning, and related areas.

## üî¨ Research Experience

- **AI Singapore: Automated assessment of trustworthiness for AI Training Programs**  
  *Dec 2023 - Present*  
  Introduces a theoretical approach that leverages regret minimization within a teacher-student framework to provide immediate training feedback and fairness comparison. Allowing sample efficiency while preserving optimal solution. 

- **AI Singapore: ML safety navigation algorithm for CPS system**  
  *Status: Paper Accepted, Oct 2022 - Oct 2024*  
  We modeled the problem of lane-keeping as a constrained optimization problem and presented a constrained RL based solution to the problem. The weight coefficients are adaptively learned without scenario-specific tuning and grid search. Empirically, we observe that our approach surpasses traditional RL-based approaches.

- **Mechanical Engineering Project: Individual Voting for RL and Search-based Algorithm Combination in Multi-agent Pathfinding**  
  *Aug 2021~Oct 2022*  
  Proposed an Individual Voting mechanism to optimize the pathfinding algorithm's performance in dead/livelock situations. A decentralized RL algorithm and a centralized search-based algorithm are learned to combine.  

- **Final Year Project: Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control Problem**  
  *Sept 2020 - May 2021*  
  Implemented a RL-based algorithm for robust manipulator operation using RGB image inputs and Cartesian coordinate outputs. Achieved autonomous grasping for diverse workpiece structures.
