I am currently a **Research Assistant** under the **AI Singapore Programme** at the **CPS Research Group**, Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I possess in-depth expertise in machine learning research and algorithm development. My research interest includes:
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Robotic Control Optimization
  - Safety mechanisms of Machine Learning

In addition to these core areas, I am eager to expand my research into emerging fields that align with my current expertise, such as continuous learning, federated learning, and related areas.
